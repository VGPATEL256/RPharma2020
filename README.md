================

## Introduction

Test a [link](Exercises/01_ann_prototype.md)

This is the GitHub repository for the Workshop: “Artificial neural
networks in R with Keras and TensorFlow” at [The second annual R/Pharma
conference held August 21, 22, and 23, 2019, Harvard University,
Cambridge, US](http://rinpharma.com/)

Everything you need to know can be found at the RStudio page on [R
Interface to TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/). Here you can
also find more on [keras](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras/), with
[examples](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/keras/articles/examples/) and
[invited blog posts](https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/)

## Getting started - Complete the following 10 easy steps, to be able to run the workshop

1.  Go to <https://rstudio.cloud/> (Create an account if you do not have
    one)
2.  Find the button “New Project” and click the arrow down symbol
3.  Choose “New Project from Git Repo”
4.  In the “URL of your Git repository”, enter
    <https://github.com/leonjessen/RPharma2019> and click “OK”
5.  “Deploying Project” will now appear and after some time a new
    session is loaded
6.  Name your project in the upper left corner, where it says “Your
    Workspace / Untitled Project \<- Click to name you project”
7.  In the lower right pane (`Files`), you will now see all the workshop
    materials, i.e. files for talks and exercises
8.  Locate and source the script `R/00_setup.R`, this will install all
    the nessesary libraries. *Note: When prompted for installing
    miniconda, just type `Y` and hit the return key*
9.  Return to <https://github.com/leonjessen/RPharma2019>, find and
    follow “Schedule Wednesday August 21st 2019”
10. Have fun\!

## Schedule Wednesday August 21st 2019

At the workshop, the aim is to briefly introduce the participants to the
theory of artificial neural networks and the follow this up with a
series of interchanging brief talks and longer exercises aiming at
building inital hands on experience. The schedule is as follows:
